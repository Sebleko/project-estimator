project_description = """
HealthTrak is a comprehensive remote patient monitoring system designed to help healthcare providers track and manage patients with chronic conditions outside of traditional clinical settings. The system will collect vital health data from various patient wearable devices, process this data to identify trends and potential health issues, and provide a secure platform for healthcare providers to monitor their patients' health status in real-time. The system aims to reduce hospital readmissions, improve patient outcomes, and enable more efficient healthcare delivery through early intervention and continuous monitoring.

   - Data collection should occur at configurable intervals (continuous, hourly, daily) depending on patient needs

2. **Data Processing and Analysis**
   - System must process collected data in near real-time
   - System must identify trends and anomalies in patient data
   - System must generate alerts based on configurable thresholds for different vital signs
   - System must support machine learning models for predictive analysis of patient deterioration

3. **User Interfaces**
   - System must provide a web portal for healthcare providers to view patient data
   - System must provide a mobile application for patients to view their own data and receive guidance
   - System must support role-based access control (patient, nurse, doctor, administrator)
   - User interfaces must display data visualizations for easy interpretation of trends

4. **Communication**
   - System must send automated alerts to healthcare providers based on predefined conditions
   - System must support secure messaging between patients and healthcare providers
   - System must be able to send reminders to patients for medication, measurements, or appointments

5. **Security and Compliance**
   - System must comply with HIPAA regulations for handling patient health information
   - System must implement end-to-end encryption for all data transmission

   - System must support integration with pharmacy systems for medication management

## Non-functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - System must support at least 10,000 concurrent patients sending data
   - System must process and store at least 100 million data points per day
   - Alerts for critical conditions must be generated within 30 seconds of data receipt
   - Web and mobile interfaces must load within 3 seconds under normal conditions

2. **Reliability**
   - System must be available 99.9% of the time (excluding planned maintenance)
   - System must include redundancy for all critical components
   - Data loss must be prevented through appropriate backup mechanisms
   - System must gracefully degrade functionality in case of component failures

3. **Scalability**
   - System must be horizontally scalable to accommodate growing patient numbers
   - System must support adding new types of medical devices and data formats
   - System architecture must allow for geographic distribution

4. **Maintainability**
   - System must be designed with modular components for easier maintenance
   - System must include comprehensive monitoring and diagnostics
   - System must support zero-downtime updates for most components
   - System must include automated testing for all critical functions

"## Patient User Stories

1. As a patient with diabetes, I want to automatically sync my glucose meter readings with the system so that I don't have to manually record my levels.

2. As a patient with hypertension, I want to see visualizations of my blood pressure trends over time so that I can understand how my lifestyle affects my condition.

3. As a patient on multiple medications, I want to receive reminders when it's time to take my medicine so that I don't miss doses.

4. As a patient recovering from surgery, I want to communicate with my healthcare provider through the app so that I can ask questions without scheduling an appointment.

5. As a patient with a chronic condition, I want to receive educational content relevant to my condition so that I can better manage my health.

6. As a patient with limited mobility, I want to report symptoms through the app so that my doctor can assess whether I need to come in for an appointment.

## Healthcare Provider User Stories

7. As a nurse, I want to view a dashboard of all my assigned patients so that I can prioritize those who need immediate attention.

8. As a doctor, I want to receive alerts when my patients' vital signs exceed thresholds so that I can intervene before complications develop.

9. As a care coordinator, I want to see which patients haven't submitted their readings so that I can follow up with them.

10. As a specialist, I want to review a patient's complete health data history before their appointment so that I can provide more informed care.

11. As a healthcare provider, I want to set different alert thresholds for different patients so that I can provide personalized care.

12. As a physician, I want to approve or adjust medication reminders for my patients so that their treatment plan is accurately reflected in the system.

## Administrator User Stories

13. As a system administrator, I want to manage user accounts and permissions so that appropriate access controls are maintained.

14. As a hospital administrator, I want to view aggregated, anonymized data so that I can assess the effectiveness of remote monitoring programs.

15. As a clinic manager, I want to generate reports on patient engagement so that I can identify opportunities for improvement.

16. As a technical administrator, I want to monitor system performance so that I can address issues before they affect users.

17. As a compliance officer, I want to review audit logs so that I can ensure the system is being used appropriately.

18. As an IT administrator, I want to integrate the system with our existing EHR so that patient data is consolidated in one place.
